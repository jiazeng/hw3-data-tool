Tool Description

In your Readme.md file of your GitHub repository, you must provide a detailed defense of your choice of visual encodings and control features. For your visual layout, describe why it is an optimal choice for expressing your data (~ 1 paragraph). Then, for each controlling element, detail how it enables your user to ask different questions (~1 paragraph). You should include specific examples of insights you discovered through the use of these tools. 

This graph describes the 2014 vehicle price in the U.S. I use divided bar charts as my visual layout. I chose to use a bar chart because it is easy to summarize a relative large data set in a simple visual form. I want user to be able to compare among the car types and car make easily. When users hover over car make column on the left, The bars can be perceived as the relative position along the common standard (axis). 


The bar
•	Grouped bar chart
Grouped bar chart uses mainly judging relative position along a common scale as the elementary perceptual task. By comparing the position of the bars with the axis, people can tell the relative quantity that the bars represent. Bar chart also uses length and area of the rectangles for people to decode the relative values that the bars represent in comparison to each other and the common scale.
•	Divided bar chart
Divided bar chart is similar with bar chart. The bars can be perceived as the relative position along the common standard (axis). The bars are divided into separate sections, the bottom parts can also be understood by the relative position, while other sections are decoded by the length of the bars since they do not align on the same line.
